##*A little bit about me.* 
My studies at the university and further work had nothing to do with IT-technologies, and even more so with development. The passion for development arose suddenly, and was associated with the desire to become part of the IT community, which is increasingly absorbing all spheres of life and the world as a whole. Working in the field of law and public service allowed us to learn perseverance, attentiveness, the ability to make decisions in stressful situations, as well as to find a common language both with colleagues and with people in general. I am sure that the acquired skills and the desire to learn something new all the time will help me in mastering and further work with front-end development.
